Things to ask at interview (as interviewee).

Partially based on talk by Alex Chernyi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM2YpmeH6l4

* Product(s) (customers, goals, features, targets)
* Work (main directions, 3 typical tasks, life of a task, how many commits merged last month)
* Team (size, competencies, background/experience, who plans to quit, jerks)
* SW stack (languages, libraries, frameworks, IDE, target platforms)
* Development process (methodology, regular meetings/reports, planning and tracking, DoD, how disagreements are resolved, onboarding)
* Development practices (CI, code review, static/dynamic analysis, coverage)
* Legacy code and tech debt (size, policy, how much time spent on refactoring monthly)
* Upstreaming (how many commits contributed last month)
