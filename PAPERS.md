Guidelines for paper review process.

# Why

Papers need to be investigated to
  * understand industry trends
  * find new ideas (for projects, co-ops, etc.)
  * make better design decisions (e.g. select framework or algorithm)

# Research team

To enable a paper review process TL will first need to form a research sub-team.
I recommend to include responsible and performant team members
who already had some exposure to paper reviews (e.g. in institute)
and at least tolerate research activities (not all engineers do).

# Sources

This team should first come up with a list of paper sources.

Usually these would be relevant conferences in industry and academia
but YouTube channels and even blogs are also useful.
High-quality manuals for state-of-the-art industry solutions
are relevant too (for example User/Programmer Guides for TI DSPs or
Cell Broadband Engine).

Publications of past 3-5 years will provide initial backlog of papers.
New publications will need to be monitored regularly (e.g. quarterly for conferences).

# Selecting papers

As there will be too many published papers the team will have to come up
with some filters for papers. For example
  * relevant topics keywords
  * important authors
  * highly influential (i.e. oft cited) papers
  * surveys

# Reviews

Each paper should be carefully studied and presented to team.
In addition References and Cited By also need to be checked and
relevant papers should be added to backlog.
For high quality papers it also makes sense to study other papers
of the same author / research team.

The following topics should be covered in presentation:
  * background (5W)
  * problem which authors were solving
  * challenges that they had to overcome
  * important implementation details (useful insights, methods, design decisions, etc.)
    - do not expect to find complete solution for your problems
  * results
  * limitations
  * relevance to team directions
