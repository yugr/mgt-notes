Guidelines for paper review process.

# Research team

To enable a paper review process TL will first need to form a research sub-team.
I recommend to include responsible and performant team members
who already had some exposure to paper reviews (e.g. in institute)
and at least tolerate research activities (not all engineers do).

# Sources

This team should first come up with a list of paper sources.

Usually these would be relevant conferences in industry and academia
but YouTube channels and even blogs are also useful.

Publications of past 3-5 years will provide initial backlog of papers.
New publications will need to be monitored regularly (e.g. quarterly for conferences).

# Selecting papers

As there will be too many published papers the team will have to come up
with some filters. For example
  * very relevant direction
  * important authors
  * highly influential (i.e. oft cited) papers
  * surveys

# Reviews

Each paper should be carefully studied and presented to team.
In addition References and Cited By also need to be checked and
relevant papers should be added to backlog.
For high quality papers it also makes sense to study other papers
of the same author / research team.

The following topics should be covered in presentation:
  * background (5W)
  * problem which authors were solving
  * challenges that they had to overcome
  * important implementation details (useful insights, methods, etc.)
  * results
  * limitations
  * relevance to team directions
