Things to do and check during new employee's (NE) probation period.

First perform a thourough [bringup](BRINGUP.md) and
let NE install the necessary environment.

Allocate several diverse tasks from different areas
of the project e.g.
  - install environment
  - write new tests (preferably complex ones)
  - implement low-priority features
  - investigate new directions

Perform regular (at least bi-weekly) checks on status.
Pay special attention to
  - how fast your requests are addressed
    (do they need to be tracked to be done?)
  - how fast code is written
  - code quality
    * formatting
    * corner cases
    * error checking
    * what else ???
  - how fast PR comments are addressed
  - tolerance to critics (in PRs or elsewhere)
  - how deep is analysis (e.g. are some hidden issues
    uncovered)
  - how well NE communicates his plans, goals,
    designs
  - overall interest in technology
  - how proactive NE is
    * communicates with other team members,
      requests necessary permissions,
      fixes unrelated issues in codebase, etc.
