Some qualities which all good manager that I knew had:
  - can quickly understand issue at any level of stack
    and get to the bottom of it
  - can quickly explain issue and how to solve it
    to any engineer/manager in company
  - can suggest a way to quickly and efficiently verify
    any technical solution
