* Make high-level design for requirements from project charter
* Make project map
    * based on high-level plan, milestones and project charter
    * focus on detecting independent activities
* Collect estimates from engineers:
    * preliminary sessions to go over project map
    * decompose project map / WBS
    * ideal hours (pure work, no delays) and comments if any
    * need to decompose further if can't estimate
* Construct schedule
