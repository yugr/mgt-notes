* Make high-level design for requirements from project charter
* Make project map / WBS
    * based on high-level plan, milestones and project charter
    * focus on detecting independent activities
* Refine project map with engineers
    * decompose goals/activities
    * identify technical risks and limitations
    * identify alternative approaches
    * identify hidden activities (e.g. interfacing to external systems)
* Collect estimates from engineers:
    * use ideal hours (pure work, no delays) and comments if any
    * decompose further if can't estimate
* Construct schedule
